# Lyft_Baywheels_Capstone
Bike shares are great, but you may be wondering why there isn't a station near your house or a busy part of town. You may want to propose a new station. A simple way to evaluate whether your proposed station will be viable, and have enough users, is to compare to existing stations. Since bike share bikes are often used for getting to or from public transit, the distance to BART and Muni will also be considered.

The Lyft Baywheels bike share provides data for trips taken using their bikes. The data includes the station names, locations, and number of trips started and finished there. From this data I calculated the number of trips per station per week and found which stations are more or less popular. I also calculated how far the stations are from public transit. I fed this into a machine learning model to predict the popularity of a proposed station location.
